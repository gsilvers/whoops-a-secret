* Exfiltrate a Secret

This repository is an example of how to extract secret data from a Github repository using only tools that Github makes available without merging anything to the main branch. While I fully expect that users and Github are aware that there are tons of ways to un-mask a secret after it's ingected into the runtime I do not believe users would suspect that they could do so using actions created by Github. In this case all that is required to execute the vulnerability is:

- Access to run github actions in the repository
- Access to raise a pull request in the repository
- Access to use the secret
- Github action runner with Cat
- This github action step [[https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/tree/releases/v1][here]]

With only these tools one can access the plain text value of a secret within an github action.

** Preparation

This repository has a set of per environment secrets
